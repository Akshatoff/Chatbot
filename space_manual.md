# Space Emergency Survival Manual (ASTRIX Core Data)

## Oxygen Leak Procedure
1. Identify if the leak is localized or cabin-wide.
2. Close all hatches around the suspected breach.
3. Activate emergency oxygen override valve.
4. Check suit seals and helmet locks.
5. Report current oxygen level and pressure reading.

## Fire in Spacecraft
1. Do NOT use water-based extinguishers. Use CO₂.
2. Isolate the affected module.
3. Shut off ventilation to prevent smoke circulation.
4. Ensure crew breathe through oxygen masks.
5. Report smoke density and temperature changes.

## Decompression / Pressure Loss
1. Close nearest airlock seals.
2. Activate pressure stabilization system.
3. Do not remove suits until cabin pressure is confirmed safe.

## Astronaut Medical Support
### Hypoxia Symptoms
- Dizziness, confusion, weakness.

### Hypoxia Response
1. Increase oxygen flow.
2. Have astronaut sit and breathe slowly.
3. Provide 200-300 ml water.

### Panic/Stress Response
1. Inhale 4 seconds.
2. Hold 3 seconds.
3. Exhale 5 seconds.
4. Repeat 6 cycles.

## Spacewalk (EVA) Critical Safety
1. Always tether.
2. Maintain radio contact.
3. Always track oxygen timer.
